# Fibonacci Calculator App

A Python application that calculates the Fibonacci sequence and demonstrates the Golden Ratio convergence, featuring robust input validation and a reward ASCII dinosaur.

## Technical Features
- Input Validation:
  - Ensures positive integer input using try/except blocks
  - Handles non-numeric inputs gracefully
  - Prevents negative number inputs
  - Continuous prompt until valid input received

- Fibonacci Sequence:
  - Efficient calculation using list indexing [-1] and [-2]
  - Dynamic list growth with .append()
  - Memory-efficient implementation

- Golden Ratio Calculation:
  - Calculates ratios between consecutive numbers
  - Demonstrates convergence to Phi (1.618...)
  - Uses floating-point division for accuracy

- User Interface:
  - Clear output formatting
  - Descriptive success messages
  - ASCII art dinosaur reward
  - Step-by-step result display

## How to Use
1. Run the program
2. Enter a positive integer when prompted
3. View the generated Fibonacci sequence
4. See the Golden Ratio convergence through consecutive number ratios
5. Get rewarded with an ASCII dinosaur!

## Code Structure
- Clean code organization with descriptive comments
- Modular design for easy maintenance
- Efficient algorithm implementation
- Error handling best practices

## Mathematical Background
The Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the last two numbers to get the next number. The ratio between consecutive numbers converges to the Golden Ratio (â‰ˆ 1.618), a mathematical constant found throughout nature.

## Example Output
