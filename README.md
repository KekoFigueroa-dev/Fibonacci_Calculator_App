# Fibonacci_Calculator_Ap# Fibonacci Calculator App

A Python application that calculates the Fibonacci sequence and demonstrates the Golden Ratio relationship between consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

## Description

This application:
- Calculates the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence
- Displays the sequence
- Computes and shows the ratios between consecutive numbers
- Demonstrates how these ratios approach the Golden Ratio (Phi â‰ˆ 1.618...)

## How to Use

1. Run the program
2. Enter the number of Fibonacci terms you want to calculate
3. The program will display:
   - The Fibonacci sequence up to your specified number
   - The Golden Ratio values between consecutive terms

## Example Output
```
Welcome to the Fibonacci Calculator App

## Mathematical Background
The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers converges to the Golden Ratio (approximately 1.618), a mathematical constant found throughout nature and art.
